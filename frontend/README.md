## 🔨 Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. Component Communication
**Challenge**: Managing state between parent and child components for booking flow
**Solution**: Used callback functions and lifted state up to manage data flow effectively

### 2. Form Validation
**Challenge**: Implementing comprehensive client-side validation with good UX
**Solution**: Created reusable validation logic with real-time error display and user-friendly messages

### 3. Responsive Design
**Challenge**: Ensuring consistent UI across different screen sizes
**Solution**: Implemented mobile-first CSS with flexible grid layouts and media queries

### 4. Database Design
**Challenge**: Creating efficient database schema for doctors, schedules, and appointments
**Solution**: Normalized database structure with proper foreign key relationships and indexes

### 5. Date/Time Handling
**Challenge**: Managing appointment scheduling with proper date/time validation
**Solution**: Used native JavaScript Date objects with timezone considerations and validation

### 6. API Error Handling
**Challenge**: Graceful handling of network errors and API failures
**Solution**: Implemented try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages and fallback UI

### 7. Performance Optimization
